### About Netmon

Netmon is an easy difficulty Windows box with simple enumeration and exploitation. PRTG is running, and an FTP server with anonymous access allows reading of PRTG Network Monitor configuration files. The version of PRTG is vulnerable to RCE which can be exploited to gain a SYSTEM shell.
